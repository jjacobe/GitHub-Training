# GitHub Training

I reviewed my prior experience with GitHub and went over some tutorials with how to use GitHub. 
I made sure I could create, use and update my repositories correctly. 

Here are some links for GitHub that I used to study: 
- https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
- https://www.edureka.co/blog/how-to-use-github/
- https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners
- https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_remote_getstarted.asp?remote=github
